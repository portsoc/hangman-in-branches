## Objectives

We will be carrying out minor fixes from the previous branch but mainly we will be focusing on graphics.
More specifically, we will replace the placeholder image of the hangman with an image on a canvas that gets drawn as the user makes wrong guesses.

If you have not done so already, check out the examples in
[the Canvas Stick Figure repository](https://github.com/portsoc/Web-Canvas-Stick-Figures).
Then attempt to complete the exercises in [the canvas repository](https://github.com/portsoc/ws_canvas).

## Implementation

### Minor fixes

Before we start, we placed the call to `redrawKeyboard` in the correct line in `registerLetter`.
This was left as [a challenge in the previous branch](https://github.com/manighahrmani/hangman-in-branches/tree/5#further-exploration), make sure to check it out.

We have also tidied up the comments and written them as JSDoc comments.
You don't need to do this in your submissions but if you are interested see [this page](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html).
Now you can see our documentation by hovering over the names of documented objects (like functions) in your editor.
Try for example hovering over `registerLetter` in `index.js` in Visual Studio Code:

### Canvas

We start by replacing our placeholder image (in `index.html`) with a canvas element.
In `index.js` we select the canvas and pass it to the functions `drawHangman` alongside the number of lives.

Pay attention to how `drawHangman` is imported from the module `canvas.js` into `index.js`.
To be able to import functions, you need to change the `type` attribute of the `script` tag in `index.html` to `module` (similar to what we did with `package.json` in [the last branch](https://github.com/manighahrmani/hangman-in-branches/tree/5)): 

```html
<script src="index.js" type="module"></script>
```

`drawHangman` is the only function that is being exported in `canvas.js`.
The rest of the functions are private helper functions within this script.

Make sure to take a good look at `canvas.js`.
Most of the functions are self-explanatory and should be familiar to you especially if you have seen [the Canvas Stick Figure repository](https://github.com/portsoc/Web-Canvas-Stick-Figures).

The only thing worth nothing is that the colours in our canvas are defined using the hexadecimal colour notation.
For more information, see [this page on hex colours](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color).

To see the new changes, head to [this compare page](https://github.com/portsoc/hangman-in-branches/compare/5...6?diff=split).

## Usage

Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Next, run the start script to start the server:

```
npm start
```

The website is now running locally on port 8080 so view it by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
Stop the server with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the shell.

## Todo

This is our to-do list from the previous branch.
The open tasks are going to be addressed in later branches:

- [x] At the moment the user cannot win even if they guess all the letters correctly.

- [x] Another issue that we have is that the user can guess the same letter multiple times.

- [x] We have no way of restarting the game other than refreshing the page.

- [ ] We have too many global variables and it is hard to keep track of the game's state.

- [x] We are not currently serving our game from a server.

- [x] The image of the hangman game is not updating as the game is being played.
